When I tried to parse the dataset it was not consistently identifying the tags for sentence type as either a new sentence or seperate sentence. It was taking me quite a bit of time to clean so I thought I different data set would be safer.  \n",

    "While looking through the corpus I noticed they had inaugural addresses. I thought it might be interesting to see if I could identify the 2 presidents writing styles. My first stab at this I felt like the sample size was too small. The corpus included all president innaugural addresses through 2008. To expand the dataset I thought it might be useful to group the speaches in some way. In Behavioral Economics researchers have done comparison's of writing in liberal vs. conservative newspapers to see if the topics were presented with some bias from different sources. \n",

      "And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.\n",
      "I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.\n",
      "We have a place, all of us, in a long story a story we continue, but whose end we will not see.\n",
      "It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.\n",
      "It is the American story a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.\n",
      "The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.\n",
      "Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.\n",
      "And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.\n",
      "Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea.\n",
      "Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.\n",
      "Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along.\n",
      "And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.\n",
      "While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country.\n",
      "The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.\n",
      "And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.\n",
      "We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.\n",
      "Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.\n",
      "And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.\n",
      "I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image.\n",
      "And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.\n",
      "America has never been united by blood or birth or soil.\n",
      "We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens.\n",
      "Every child must be taught these principles.\n",
      "Every citizen must uphold them.\n",
      "And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.\n",
      "Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.\n",
      "America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.\n",
      "A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.\n",
      "Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.\n",
      "But the stakes for America are never small.\n",
      "If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.\n",
      "If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism.\n",
      "If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.\n",
      "We must live up to the calling we share.\n",
      "Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment.\n",
      "It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.\n",
      "And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.\n",
      "America, at its best, is also courageous.\n",
      "Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good.\n",
      "Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.\n",
      "We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.\n",
      "Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.\n",
      "We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent.\n",
      "And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.\n",
      "We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.\n",
      "We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.\n",
      "The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.\n",
      "We will defend our allies and our interests.\n",
      "We will show purpose without arrogance.\n",
      "We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.\n",
      "And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.\n",
      "America, at its best, is compassionate.\n",
      "In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.\n",
      "And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.\n",
      "Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love.\n",
      "And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.\n",
      "Where there is suffering, there is duty.\n",
      "Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities.\n",
      "And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.\n",
      "Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools.\n",
      "Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.\n",
      "And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.\n",
      "Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.\n",
      "Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.\n",
      "And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.\n",
      "America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.\n",
      "Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience.\n",
      "And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.\n",
      "We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments.\n",
      "And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.\n",
      "Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.\n",
      "Sometimes in life we are called to do great things.\n",
      "But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love.\n",
      "The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.\n",
      "I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.\n",
      "In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.\n",
      "What you do is as important as anything government does.\n",
      "I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.\n",
      "I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.\n",
      "Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.\n",
      "When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it.\n",
      "When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.\n",
      "After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson: \"We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong.\n",
      "Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?\"\n",
      "Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration.\n",
      "The years and changes accumulate.\n",
      "But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.\n",
      "We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose.\n",
      "Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.\n",
      "Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.\n",
      "This work continues.\n",
      "This story goes on.\n",

      "On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.\n",
      "I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.\n",
      "At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together.\n",
      "For a half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.\n",
      "After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical\n",
      "and then there came a day of fire.\n",
      "We have seen our vulnerability and we have seen its deepest source.\n",
      "For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat.\n",
      "There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.\n",
      "We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.\n",
      "The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.\n",
      "America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one.\n",
      "From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth.\n",
      "Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave.\n",
      "Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation.\n",
      "It is the honorable achievement of our fathers.\n",
      "Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation s security, and the calling of our time.\n",
      "So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\n",
      "This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.\n",
      "Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.\n",
      "And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.\n",
      "America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling.\n",
      "Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.\n",
      "The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations.\n",
      "The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.\n",
      "America s influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America s influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom s cause.\n",
      "My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats.\n",
      "Some have unwisely chosen to test America s resolve, and have found it firm.\n",
      "We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right.\n",
      "America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.\n",
      "We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people.\n",
      "America s belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed.\n",
      "In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.\n",
      "Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt.\n",
      "Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals.\n",
      "Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul.\n",
      "We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery.\n",
      "Liberty will come to those who love it.\n",
      "Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:\n",
      "All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors.\n",
      "When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.\n",
      "Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country.\n",
      "The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.¡¨\n",
      "The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them.\n",
      "Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.\n",
      "And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help.\n",
      "Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom s enemies.\n",
      "The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies defeat.\n",
      "Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:\n",
      "From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure.\n",
      "Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon.\n",
      "Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom.\n",
      "And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it.\n",
      "By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well a fire in the minds of men.\n",
      "It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.\n",
      "A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ¡\n",
      "K the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ¡\n",
      "K the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies.\n",
      "Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.\n",
      "All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time.\n",
      "I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes.\n",
      "You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers.\n",
      "You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs.\n",
      "Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.\n",
      "America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home the unfinished work of American freedom.\n",
      "In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.\n",
      "In America s ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence.\n",
      "This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights.\n",
      "And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time.\n",
      "To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society.\n",
      "We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society.\n",
      "By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.\n",
      "In America s ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives.\n",
      "Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self.\n",
      "That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people.\n",
      "Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.\n",
      "In America s ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak.\n",
      "Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.\n",
      "Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love.\n",
      "Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth.\n",
      "And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.\n",
      "From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many.\n",
      "From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few.\n",
      "Did our generation advance the cause of freedom?\n",
      "And did our character bring credit to that cause?\n",
      "These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom.\n",
      "We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes and I will strive in good faith to heal them.\n",
      "Yet those divisions do not define America.\n",
      "We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart.\n",
      "And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free.\n",
      "We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom.\n",
      "Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events.\n",
      "Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills.\n",
      "We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul.\n",
      "When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner Freedom Now¡¨ they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.\n",
      "History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.\n",
      "When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, It rang as if it meant\n",
      "something.¡¨\n",
      "In our time it means something still.\n",
      "America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof.\n",
      "Renewed in our strength tested, but not weary\n",
      "we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.\n",
      "May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.\n",
      "Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence.\n",
      "The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are.\n",
      "In the eyes of many in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.\n",
      "Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition.\n",
      "By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.\n",
      "The business of our nation goes forward.\n",
      "These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions.\n",
      "We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history.\n",
      "It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike.\n",
      "It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.\n",
      "Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human misery and personal indignity.\n",
      "Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.\n",
      "But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending.\n",
      "For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present.\n",
      "To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.\n",
      "You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time.\n",
      "Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?\n",
      "We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow.\n",
      "And let there be no misunderstanding we are going to begin to act, beginning today.\n",
      "The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.\n",
      "They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away.\n",
      "They will go away because we, as Americans, have the capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.\n",
      "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.\n",
      "From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.\n",
      "But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?\n",
      "All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.\n",
      "The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.\n",
      "We hear much of special interest groups.\n",
      "Our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected.\n",
      "It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines.\n",
      "It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we are sick professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers.\n",
      "They are, in short, \"We the people,\" this breed called Americans.\n",
      "Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination.\n",
      "Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work.\n",
      "Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs.\n",
      "All must share in the productive work of this \"new beginning\" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy.\n",
      "With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.\n",
      "So, as we begin, let us take inventory.\n",
      "We are a nation that has a government not the other way around.\n",
      "And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth.\n",
      "Our Government has no power except that granted it by the people.\n",
      "It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.\n",
      "It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people.\n",
      "All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\n",
      "Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention to do away with government.\n",
      "It is, rather, to make it work work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.\n",
      "Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.\n",
      "If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before.\n",
      "Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth.\n",
      "The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.\n",
      "It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government.\n",
      "It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams.\n",
      "We are not, as some would have us believe, loomed to an inevitable decline.\n",
      "I do not believe in a fate that will all on us no matter what we do.\n",
      "I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.\n",
      "So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal.\n",
      "Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength.\n",
      "And let us renew; our faith and our hope.\n",
      "We have every right to dream heroic dreams.\n",
      "Those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where to look.\n",
      "You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates.\n",
      "Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond.\n",
      "You meet heroes across a counter and they are on both sides of that counter.\n",
      "There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity.\n",
      "They are individuals and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education.\n",
      "Their patriotism is quiet but deep.\n",
      "Their values sustain our national life.\n",
      "I have used the words \"they\" and \"their\" in speaking of these heroes.\n",
      "I could say \"you\" and \"your\" because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak you, the citizens of this blessed land.\n",
      "Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God.\n",
      "We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup.\n",
      "How can we love our country and not love our countrymen, and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self- sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?\n",
      "Can we solve the problems confronting us?\n",
      "Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic \"yes.\"\n",
      "To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy.\n",
      "In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity.\n",
      "Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government.\n",
      "Progress may be slow measured in inches and feet, not miles\n",
      "but we will progress.\n",
      "Is it time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden.\n",
      "And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles, there will be no compromise.\n",
      "On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, \"Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of....\n",
      "On you depend the fortunes of America.\n",
      "You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn.\n",
      "Act worthy of yourselves.\n",
      "\"\n",
      "Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.\n",
      "And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world.\n",
      "We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.\n",
      "To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.\n",
      "We will match loyalty with loyalty.\n",
      "We will strive for mutually beneficial relations.\n",
      "We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for or own sovereignty is not for sale.\n",
      "As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people.\n",
      "We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it now or ever.\n",
      "Our forbearance should never be misunderstood.\n",
      "Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will.\n",
      "When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act.\n",
      "We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.\n",
      "Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.\n",
      "It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.\n",
      "It is a weapon that we as Americans do have.\n",
      "Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.\n",
      "I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful.\n",
      "We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.\n",
      "It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.\n",
      "This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.\n",
      "Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history.\n",
      "At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.\n",
      "Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George Washington, Father of our country.\n",
      "A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly.\n",
      "He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood.\n",
      "Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson.\n",
      "The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence.\n",
      "And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial.\n",
      "Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.\n",
      "Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David.\n",
      "They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.\n",
      "Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I spoke of earlier.\n",
      "Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.\n",
      "Under one such marker lies a young man who left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division.\n",
      "There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.\n",
      "We are told that on his body was found a diary.\n",
      "On the flyleaf under the heading, \"My Pledge,\" he had written these words: \"America must win this war.\n",
      "Therefore, I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.\"\n",
      "The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make.\n",
      "It does require, however, our best effort, and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together, with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.\n",
      "And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that?\n",
      "We are Americans.\n",
      "God bless you, and thank you.\n",
      "Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator Mitchell, Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michael, and fellow citizens, neighbors, and friends: There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history.\n",
      "President Reagan, on behalf of our Nation, I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America.\n",
      "I have just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his.\n",
      "It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today, not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration, but because Washington remains the Father of our Country.\n",
      "And he would, I think, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity these 200 years since our government began.\n",
      "We meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends.\n",
      "For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.\n",
      "And my first act as President is a prayer.\n",
      "I ask you to bow your heads:\n",
      "Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love.\n",
      "Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely.\n",
      "Make us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: \"Use power to help people.\"\n",
      "For we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name.\n",
      "There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people.\n",
      "Help us to remember it, Lord.\n",
      "Amen.\n",
      "I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise.\n",
      "We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better.\n",
      "For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over.\n",
      "The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree.\n",
      "A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on.\n",
      "There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken.\n",
      "There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path.\n",
      "But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.\n",
      "Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom.\n",
      "Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity.\n",
      "The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.\n",
      "We know what works: Freedom works.\n",
      "We know what's right: Freedom is right.\n",
      "We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.\n",
      "For the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all history, man does not have to invent a system by which to live.\n",
      "We don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better.\n",
      "We don't have to wrest justice from the kings.\n",
      "We only have to summon it from within ourselves.\n",
      "We must act on what we know.\n",
      "I take as my guide the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in all things, generosity.\n",
      "America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we cannot help but love.\n",
      "We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and that our strength is a force for good.\n",
      "But have we changed as a nation even in our time?\n",
      "Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?\n",
      "My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions.\n",
      "They are not the measure of our lives.\n",
      "In our hearts we know what matters.\n",
      "We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account.\n",
      "We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it.\n",
      "What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there?\n",
      "That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us?\n",
      "Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better, and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?\n",
      "No President, no government, can teach us to remember what is best in what we are.\n",
      "But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must.\n",
      "America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle.\n",
      "We as a people have such a purpose today.\n",
      "It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world.\n",
      "My friends, we have work to do.\n",
      "There are the homeless, lost and roaming.\n",
      "There are the children who have nothing, no love, no normalcy.\n",
      "There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums.\n",
      "There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets.\n",
      "There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love.\n",
      "They need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.\n",
      "The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems.\n",
      "But we have learned that is not so.\n",
      "And in any case, our funds are low.\n",
      "We have a deficit to bring down.\n",
      "We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need.\n",
      "We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety.\n",
      "And then we will do the wisest thing of all: We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows the goodness and the courage of the American people.\n",
      "I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done.\n",
      "We must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young.\n",
      "For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation, but so is stewardship.\n",
      "And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age.\n",
      "I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good.\n",
      "We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding.\n",
      "We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies.\n",
      "I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my government to become involved.\n",
      "The old ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.\n",
      "We need a new engagement, too, between the Executive and the Congress.\n",
      "The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate.\n",
      "We must bring the Federal budget into balance.\n",
      "And we must ensure that America stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound.\n",
      "But, of course, things may be difficult.\n",
      "We need compromise; we have had dissension.\n",
      "We need harmony; we have had a chorus of discordant voices.\n",
      "For Congress, too, has changed in our time.\n",
      "There has grown a certain divisiveness.\n",
      "We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged, but each other's motives.\n",
      "And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other.\n",
      "It has been this way since Vietnam.\n",
      "That war cleaves us still.\n",
      "But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and surely the statute of limitations has been reached.\n",
      "This is a fact: The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory.\n",
      "A new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be made new again.\n",
      "To my friends and yes, I do mean friends in the loyal opposition and\n",
      "yes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand.\n",
      "I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Speaker.\n",
      "I am putting out my hand to you Mr. Majority Leader.\n",
      "For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand.\n",
      "We can't turn back clocks, and I don't want to.\n",
      "But when our fathers were young, Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge.\n",
      "And we don't wish to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live.\n",
      "Let us negotiate soon and hard.\n",
      "But in the end, let us produce.\n",
      "The American people await action.\n",
      "They didn't send us here to bicker.\n",
      "They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. \"\n",
      "In crucial things, unity\" and this, my friends, is crucial.\n",
      "To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace.\n",
      "The \"offered hand\" is a reluctant fist; but once made, strong, and can be used with great effect.\n",
      "There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for.\n",
      "Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered.\n",
      "Good will begets good will.\n",
      "Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.\n",
      "Great nations like great men must keep their word.\n",
      "When America says something, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps.\n",
      "We will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment, but subtlety, too, is good and has its place.\n",
      "While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress.\n",
      "One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience.\n",
      "But hope is good, and so are strength and vigilance.\n",
      "Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled.\n",
      "But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by, and the women who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns.\n",
      "I don't mean this to be sentimental.\n",
      "I mean that on days like this, we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind.\n",
      "Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land.\n",
      "And to them I say, thank you for watching democracy's big day.\n",
      "For democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze.\n",
      "And to all I say: No matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation.\n",
      "A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls.\n",
      "In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, an easy- goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.\n",
      "There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance.\n",
      "The most obvious now is drugs.\n",
      "And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country.\n",
      "And there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop.\n",
      "And so, there is much to do; and tomorrow the work begins.\n",
      "I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead.\n",
      "For our problems are large, but our heart is larger.\n",
      "Our challenges are great, but our will is greater.\n",
      "And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.\n",
      "Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that.\n",
      "But I see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning.\n",
      "The new breeze blows,\n",
      "a page turns, the story unfolds.\n",
      "And so today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity shared, and written, together.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "God bless you and God bless the United States of America.\n",
      "Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans and my fellow citizens of the world community: I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment.\n",
      "In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.\n",
      "Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique.\n",
      "But some stand out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries.\n",
      "This can be such a moment.\n",
      "Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized.\n",
      "The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.\n",
      "In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth.\n",
      "For the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.\n",
      "Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation.\n",
      "Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years the beginning of the third millennium.\n",
      "What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.\n",
      "The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.\n",
      "This honor now beckons America the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.\n",
      "If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.\n",
      "This is our summons to greatness.\n",
      "I believe the American people are ready to answer this call.\n",
      "The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement.\n",

      "We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.\n",
      "We have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white.\n",
      "We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today.\n",
      "I know America's youth.\n",
      "I believe in them.\n",
      "We can be proud that they are better educated, more committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history.\n",
      "No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it.\n",
      "Because our strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope.\n",
      "Standing in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear.\n",
      "He could say in surveying the Nation's troubles: \"They concern, thank God, only material things.\"\n",
      "Our crisis today is the reverse.\n",
      "We have found ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon, but falling into raucous discord on earth.\n",
      "We are caught in war, wanting peace.\n",
      "We are torn by division, wanting unity.\n",
      "We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment.\n",
      "We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them.\n",
      "To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit.\n",
      "To find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.\n",
      "When we listen to \"the better angels of our nature,\" we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.\n",
      "Greatness comes in simple trappings.\n",
      "The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us.\n",
      "To lower our voices would be a simple thing.\n",
      "In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.\n",
      "We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.\n",
      "For its part, government will listen.\n",
      "We will strive to listen in new ways to the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart to the injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.\n",
      "Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in.\n",
      "Those left behind, we will help to catch up.\n",
      "For all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure.\n",

      "In this past third of a century, government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all our previous history.\n",
      "In pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in education; in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life in all these and more, we will and must pres urgently forward.\n",
      "We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home.\n",
      "The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.\n",
      "But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.\n",
      "Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed.\n",
      "What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all.\n",
      "The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with the people we can do everything.\n",
      "To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.\n",
      "With these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing.\n",
      "I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease.\n",
      "I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice.\n",
      "I ask you to join in a high adventure one as rich as humanity itself, and as exciting as the times we live in.\n",
      "The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny.\n",
      "Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole.\n",
      "The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use.\n",

      "No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not.\n",
      "To go forward at all is to go forward together.\n",
      "This means black and white together, as one nation, not two.\n",
      "The laws have caught up with our conscience.\n",
      "What remains is to give life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before man.\n",
      "As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind.\n",
      "Let us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it permanent.\n",
      "After a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation.\n",
      "Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open.\n",

      "We cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we can try to make no one our enemy.\n",
      "Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful competition not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in enriching the life of man.\n",
      "As we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together not as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new adventure to be shared.\n",
      "With those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the poor and the hungry.\n",
      "But to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be.\n",
      "Over the past twenty years, since I first came to this Capital as a freshman Congressman, I have visited most of the nations of the world.\n",
      "I have come to know the leaders of the world, and the great forces, the hatreds, the fears that divide the world.\n",
      "I know that peace does not come through wishing for it that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.\n",
      "I also know the people of the world.\n",
      "I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain of a man wounded in battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son.\n",
      "I know these have no ideology, no race.\n",
      "I know America.\n",
      "I know the heart of America is good.\n",

      "To that oath I now add this sacred commitment: I shall consecrate my office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon, to the cause of peace among nations.\n",
      "Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike: The peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people, but the peace that comes \"with healing in its wings\"; with compassion for those who have suffered; with understanding for those who have opposed us; with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny.\n",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of man's first sight of the world as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness.\n",
      "As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on Christmas Eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke God's blessing on its goodness.\n",
      "In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write: \"To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold brothers who know now they are truly brothers.\"\n",
      "In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity seeing in that far perspective that man's destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on Earth itself, in our own hands, in our own hearts.\n",
      "We have endured a long night of the American spirit.\n",
      "But as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark.\n",
      "Let us gather the light.\n",
      "Our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity.\n",
      "So let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness and, \"riders on the earth together,\" let us go forward, firm in our faith, steadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our confidence in the will of God and the promise of man.\n",

      "The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.\n",
      "Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.\n",
      "At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.\n",
      "So it has been.\n",
      "So it must be with this generation of Americans.\n",
      "That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.\n",
      "Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.\n",
      "Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.\n",
      "Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.\n",
      "Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.\n",
      "These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.\n",
      "Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next generation must lower its sights.\n",
      "Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real.\n",
      "They are serious and they are many.\n",
      "They will not be met easily or in a short span of time.\n",
      "But know this, America they will be met.\n",
      "On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.\n",
      "On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics.\n",
      "We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.\n",
      "The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.\n",
      "In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.\n",
      "It must be earned.\n",
      "Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less.\n",
      "It has not been the path for the faint-hearted for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.\n",
      "Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things'some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.\n",
      "For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.\n",
      "For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.\n",
      "For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.\n",
      "Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.\n",
      "They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.\n",
      "This is the journey we continue today.\n",
      "We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth.\n",
      "Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.\n",
      "Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.\n",
      "Our capacity remains undiminished.\n",
      "But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions that time has surely passed.\n",
      "Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.\n",
      "For everywhere we look, there is work to be done.\n",
      "The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.\n",
      "We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.\n",
      "We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.\n",
      "We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.\n",
      "And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.\n",
      "All this we can do.\n",
      "All this we will do.\n",
      "Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.\n",
      "Their memories are short.\n",
      "For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.\n",
      "What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.\n",
      "The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.\n",
      "Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.\n",
      "Where the answer is no, programs will end.\n",
      "And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.\n",
      "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill.\n",
      "Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.\n",
      "The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.\n",
      "As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.\n",
      "Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.\n",
      "Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake.\n",
      "And so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more.\n",
      "Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.\n",
      "They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.\n",
      "Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.\n",
      "We are the keepers of this legacy.\n",
      "Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.\n",
      "We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan.\n",
      "With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet.\n",
      "We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.\n",
      "For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.\n",
      "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers.\n",
      "We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.\n",
      "To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\n",
      "To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.\n",
      "To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\n",
      "To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.\n",
      "And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.\n",
      "For the world has changed, and we must change with it.\n",
      "As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.\n",
      "They have something to tell us, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages.\n",
      "We honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves.\n",
      "And yet, at this moment a moment that will define a generation it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.\n",
      "For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies.\n",
      "It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours.\n",
      "It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.\n",
      "Our challenges may be new.\n",
      "The instruments with which we meet them may be new.\n",
      "But those values upon which our success depends honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism these things are old.\n",
      "These things are true.\n",
      "They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history.\n",
      "What is demanded then is a return to these truths.\n",
      "What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit,\n",
      "so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.\n",
      "This is the price and the promise of citizenship.\n",
      "This is the source of our confidence the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.\n",
      "This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.\n",
      "So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled.\n",
      "In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river.\n",
      "The capital was abandoned.\n",
      "The enemy was advancing.\n",
      "The snow was stained with blood.\n",
      "At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people: \"Let it be told to the future world ...\n",
      "that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet ...\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "America!\n",
      "In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words.\n",
      "With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.\n",
      "Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "God bless you.\n",
      "And God bless the United States of America.\n",
      "My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.\n",
      "This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring.\n",
      "A spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America.\n",
      "When our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world, and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America, to endure, would have to change.\n",
      "Not change for change sake, but change to preserve America's ideals: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.\n",
      "Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless.\n",
      "Each generation of American's must define what it means to be an American.\n",
      "On behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America and I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism and communism.\n",
      "Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom, but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.\n",
      "Raised in unrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality, and deep divisions among our own people.\n",
      "When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news travelled slowly across the land by horseback, and across the ocean by boat.\n",
      "Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously tobillions around the world.\n",
      "Communications and commerce are global.\n",
      "Investment is mobile.\n",
      "Technology is almost magical, and ambition for a better life is now universal.\n",
      "We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the Earth.\n",
      "Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world, and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.\n",
      "This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it.\n",
      "But when most people are working harder for less, when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and small; when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.\n",
      "We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so.\n",
      "Instead we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.\n",
      "Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths.\n",
      "Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people, and we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us.\n",
      "From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil Rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.\n",
      "Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time.\n",
      "Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time.\n",
      "Let us embrace it.\n",
      "Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal.\n",
      "There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.\n",
      "And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun.\n",
      "To renew America we must be bold.\n",
      "We must do what no generation has had to do before.\n",
      "We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and in their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity.\n",
      "It will not be easy.\n",
      "It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and done fairly.\n",
      "Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake.\n",
      "We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children.\n",
      "Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity.\n",
      "We can do no less.\n",
      "Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is.\n",
      "Posterity is the world to come, the world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibilities.\n",
      "We must do what America does best, offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.\n",
      "It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing: from our government, or from each other.\n",
      "Let us all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our communities and our country.\n",
      "To renew America we must revitalize our democracy.\n",
      "This beautiful capitol, like every capitol since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation.\n",
      "Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way.\n",
      "Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are people who want to do better, and so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to reform our politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people.\n",
      "Let us put aside personal advantage, so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America.\n",
      "Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called \"bold, persistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays.\"\n",
      "Let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it belongs.\n",
      "To renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at home.\n",
      "There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic.\n",
      "The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race: they affect us all.\n",
      "Today as an old order passes, the new world is more free, but less stable.\n",
      "Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities, and new dangers.\n",
      "Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.\n",
      "While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world.\n",
      "Together with our friends and allies, we will work together to shape change, lest it engulf us.\n",
      "When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act; with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.\n",
      "The brave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in Somalia, and wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve, but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands.\n",
      "Across the world, we see them embraced and we rejoice.\n",
      "Our hopes, our hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are building democracy and freedom.\n",
      "Their cause is America's cause.\n",
      "The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today.\n",
      "You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes in historic numbers, you have changed the face of congress, the presidency, and the political process itself.\n",
      "Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.\n",
      "Now WE must do the work the season demands.\n",
      "To that work I now turn with ALL the authority of my office.\n",
      "I ask the congress to join with me; but no president, no congress, no government can undertake THIS mission alone.\n",
      "My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.\n",
      "I challenge a new generation of YOUNG Americans to a season of service, to act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.\n",
      "There is so much to be done.\n",
      "Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit, to give of themselves in service, too.\n",
      "In serving we recognize a simple, but powerful, truth: we need each other, and we must care for one another.\n",
      "Today we do more than celebrate America, we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in revolution, and renewed through two centuries of challenge,\n",
      "an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate, we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity, the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's journey long, heroic journey must go forever upward.\n",
      "And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st Century, let us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith and discipline, and let us work until our work is done.\n",
      "The Scripture says: \"And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.\"\n",
      "From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley.\n",
      "We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the guard, and now each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the call.\n",
      "Thank you, and God bless you all.\n",
      "My fellow citizens: At this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century.\n",
      "It is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs a moment that will define our course, and our character, for decades to come.\n",
      "We must keep our old democracy forever young.\n",
      "Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of new promise.\n",
      "The promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal.\n",
      "It was extended and preserved in the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved the union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.\n",
      "Then, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the American Century.\n",
      "And what a century it has been.\n",
      "America became the world's mightiest industrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to millions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.\n",
      "Along the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in old age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer and the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and extending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.\n",
      "Now, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to choose.\n",
      "We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation from coast to coast.\n",
      "We began the 20th century with a choice, to harness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise, conservation, and human decency.\n",
      "Those choices made all the difference.\n",
      "At the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the limitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect union.\n",
      "When last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today.\n",
      "We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation.\n",
      "In these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by challenge, strengthened by achievement.\n",
      "America stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.\n",
      "Once again, our economy is the strongest on Earth.\n",
      "Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving communities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.\n",
      "Problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts: our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work.\n",
      "And once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government.\n",
      "Today we can declare: Government is not the problem, and government is not the solution.\n",
      "We the American people\n",
      "we are the solution.\n",
      "Our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.\n",
      "As times change, so government must change.\n",
      "We need a new government for a new century humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and does more with less.\n",
      "Yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do more, not less.\n",
      "The preeminent mission of our new government is to give all Americans an opportunity not a guarantee, but a real opportunity to build better lives.\n",
      "Beyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us.\n",
      "Our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship.\n",
      "And we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century.\n",
      "There is work to do, work that government alone cannot do: teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls; coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of our own lives to serve others.\n",
      "Each and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal responsibility not only for ourselves and our families, but for our neighbors and our nation.\n",
      "Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century.\n",
      "For any one of us to succeed, we must succeed as one America.\n",
      "The challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future will we be one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not?\n",
      "Will we all come together, or come apart?\n",
      "The divide of race has been America's constant curse.\n",
      "And each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices.\n",
      "Prejudice and contempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different.\n",
      "These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past.\n",
      "They plague us still.\n",
      "They fuel the fanaticism of terror.\n",
      "And they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world.\n",
      "These obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who are hated, robbing both of what they might become.\n",

      "Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first President, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my mother gave me a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet Micah: \"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.\"\n",

      "Two centuries ago our Nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom, but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation.\n",
      "I have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.\n",
      "Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty.\n",
      "It is that unique self- definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a special obligation, to take on those moral duties which, when assumed, seem invariably to be in our own best interests.\n",
      "You have given me a great responsibility to stay close to you, to be worthy of you, and to exemplify what you are.\n",

      "We have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity.\n",
      "Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.\n",
      "We have learned that more is not necessarily better, that even our great Nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems.\n",

      "We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas.\n",
      "We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled.\n",
      "We are a purely idealistic Nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness.\n",
      "Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere.\n",
      "Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights.\n",
      "We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all people.\n",
      "The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries.\n",
      "We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety.\n",
      "And we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth.\n",
      "We urge all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of death.\n",
      "Within us, the people of the United States, there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence.\n",
      "And I join in the hope that when my time as your President has ended, people might say this about our Nation:\n",
      "That we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed our search for humility, mercy, and justice; - that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity; - that we had found productive work for those able to perform it; - that we had strengthened the American family, which is the basi of our society; - that we had ensured respect for the law, and equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor; - and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government once again.\n",
      "I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values.\n",
      "These are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation of our Nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream.\n",
      "Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens, we observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning signifying renewal, as well as change.\n",
      "For I have sworn I before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears l prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.\n",
      "The world is very different now.\n",
      "For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.\n",
      "And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.\n",
      "We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.\n",
      "Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.\n",
      "Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\n",
      "This much we pledge and more.\n",
      "To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.\n",
      "United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures.\n",
      "Divided, there is little we can do for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.\n",
      "To those new States whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\n",
      "We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\n",
      "But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\n",
      "To those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\n",
      "If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\n",
      "To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge to convert our good words into good deeds in a new alliance for progress to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty.\n",
      "But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers.\n",
      "Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas.\n",
      "And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.\n",
      "To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\n",
      "Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\n",
      "We dare not tempt them with weakness.\n",
      "For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\n",
      "But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.\n",
      "So let us begin anew remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\n",
      "Let us never negotiate out of fear.\n",
      "But let us never fear to negotiate.\n",
      "Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.\n",
      "Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.\n",
      "Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.\n",
      "Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.\n",
      "Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah to \"undo the heavy burdens ... and to let the oppressed go free.\"\n",
      "And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.\n",
      "All this will not be finished in the first 100 days.\n",
      "Nor will it be finished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.\n",
      "But let us begin.\n",
      "In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course.\n",
      "Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty.\n",
      "The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.\n",
      "Now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\" a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\n",
      "Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\n",
      "Will you join in that historic effort?\n",
      "In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.\n",
      "I do not shrink from this responsibility\n",
      "I welcome it.\n",
      "I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\n",
      "The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.\n",
      "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country.\n",
      "My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.\n",
      "Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.\n",
      "With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.\n",
      "My fellow countrymen, on this occasion, the oath I have taken before you and before God is not mine alone, but ours together.\n",
      "We are one nation and one people.\n",
      "Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen, but upon all citizens.\n",
      "This is the majesty and the meaning of this moment.\n",
      "For every generation, there is a destiny.\n",
      "For some, history decides.\n",
      "For this generation, the choice must be our own.\n",
      "Even now, a rocket moves toward Mars.\n",
      "It reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children, or even for ourselves m a short span of years.\n",
      "The next man to stand here will look out on a scene different from our own, because ours is a time of change rapid and fantastic change bearing the secrets of nature, multiplying the nations, placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction, shaking old values, and uprooting old ways.\n",
      "Our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people, and on their faith.\n",
      "The American Covenant\n",
      "They came here the exile and the stranger, brave but frightened to find a place where a man could be his own man.\n",
      "They made a covenant with this land.\n",
      "Conceived in justice, written in liberty, bound in union, it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind; and it binds us still.\n",
      "If we keep its terms, we shall flourish.\n",
      "Justice and Change\n",
      "First, justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land.\n",

      "In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry.\n",
      "In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die unattended.\n",
      "In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write.\n",
      "For the more than 30 years that I have served this Nation, I have believed that this injustice to our people, this waste of our resources, was our real enemy.\n",
      "For 30 years or more, with the resources I have had, I have vigilantly fought against it.\n",
      "I have learned, and I know, that it will not surrender easily.\n",
      "But change has given us new weapons.\n",
      "Before this generation of Americans is finished, this enemy will not only retreat it will be conquered.\n",
      "Justice requires us to remember that when any citizen denies his fellow, saying, \"His color is not mine,\" or \"His beliefs are strange and different,\" in that moment he betrays America, though his forebears created this Nation.\n",
      "Liberty and Change Liberty was the second article of our covenant.\n",
      "It was self-government.\n",
      "It was our Bill of Rights.\n",
      "But it was more.\n",
      "America would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself: stretching his talents, rejoicing in his work, important in the life of his neighbors and his nation.\n",
      "This has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men.\n",
      "We must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen.\n",
      "The American covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man.\n",
      "And that is today our goal.\n",
      "Thus, if as a nation there is much outside our control, as a people no stranger is outside our hope.\n",
      "Change has brought new meaning to that old mission.\n",
      "We can never again stand aside, prideful in isolation.\n",
      "Terrific dangers and troubles that we once called \"foreign\" now constantly live among us.\n",
      "If American lives must end, and American treasure be spilled, in countries we barely know, that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant.\n",
      "Think of our world as it looks from the rocket that is heading toward Mars.\n",
      "It is like a child's globe, hanging in space, the continents stuck to its side like colored maps.\n",
      "We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth.\n",
      "And each of us, in the span of time, has really only a moment among our companions.\n",
      "How incredible it is that in this fragile existence, we should hate and destroy one another.\n",
      "There are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature.\n",

      "No longer need capitalist and worker, farmer and clerk, city and countryside, struggle to divide our bounty.\n",
      "By working shoulder to shoulder, together we can increase the bounty of all.\n",
      "We have discovered that every child who learns, every man who finds work, every sick body together, like a candle added to an altar brightens the hope of all the faithful.\n",
      "So let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and to rekindle old hatreds.\n",
      "They stand in the way of a seeking nation.\n",
      "Let us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose.\n",
      "For the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife, to achieve change without hatred not without difference of opinion, but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations.\n",
      "The American Belief Under this covenant of justice, liberty, and union we have become a nation prosperous, great, and mighty.\n",
      "And we have kept our freedom.\n",
      "But we have no promise from God that our greatness will endure.\n",
      "We have been allowed by Him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit.\n",
      "I do not believe that the Great Society is the ordered, changeless, and sterile battalion of the ants.\n",
      "It is the excitement of becoming always becoming, trying, probing, falling, resting, and trying again but always trying and always gaining.\n",
